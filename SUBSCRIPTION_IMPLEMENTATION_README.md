# CRM Subscription System Implementation

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation of a pricing-based subscription model for the OrbitCRM system.

## 🎯 Overview

The subscription system provides:
- **3 Subscription Plans**: Launch, Accelerate, Scale
- **3 Self-Hosted Plans**: Essentials, Pro Deploy, Enterprise
- **Feature-based access control** based on subscription plans
- **Dynamic dashboard** showing only available features
- **Clean onboarding flow** with plan selection

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend Components

#### 1. Database Models (`backend/app/models.py`)
- `SubscriptionPlan`: Defines plan details, pricing, and features
- `CompanySubscription`: Links companies to their active plans
- `BillingHistory`: Tracks payment history
- `PlanFeature`: Defines available features and their categories

#### 2. API Endpoints (`backend/app/routes/subscription.py`)
- `GET /api/subscription/plans` - List all available plans
- `POST /api/subscription/subscribe` - Subscribe company to a plan
- `GET /api/subscription/company/{id}` - Get company's subscription
- `GET /api/subscription/company/{id}/features` - Get available features
- `PUT /api/subscription/company/{id}/cancel` - Cancel subscription

#### 3. Enhanced Onboarding (`backend/app/routes/onboarding.py`)
- Plan selection during company registration
- Automatic subscription creation
- Feature assignment based on selected plan

### Frontend Components

#### 1. CRM Plans Screen (`flutter_web/lib/pages/crm_plans_screen.dart`)
- Displays all available plans with pricing
- Plan comparison and feature lists
- Navigation to onboarding with selected plan

#### 2. Enhanced Onboarding (`flutter_web/lib/pages/onboarding_screen.dart`)
- Shows selected plan information
- Plan-specific feature display
- Seamless plan integration

#### 3. Subscription Service (`flutter_web/lib/services/subscription_service.dart`)
- API communication for subscription operations
- Plan management and feature access

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Database Setup

Run the migration script to create subscription tables:

```bash
cd backend
python create_subscription_tables.py
```

This will:
- Create all necessary subscription tables
- Initialize default plans and features
- Set up foreign key relationships

### 2. Backend Setup

The subscription system is automatically integrated. Ensure:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd flutter_web
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Feature Access Control

Features are controlled at multiple levels:

1. **Plan Level**: Each plan defines available features
2. **Company Level**: Companies inherit features from their subscription
3. **User Level**: Role-based access within available features

### Dashboard Integration

The left panel of admin dashboards dynamically shows only features available under the current subscription plan.

### Onboarding Flow

1. User visits landing page
2. Clicks "CRM Plans" button
3. Selects desired plan
4. Proceeds to onboarding with plan pre-selected
5. Company registration creates subscription automatically
